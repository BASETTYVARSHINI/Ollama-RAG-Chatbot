# Ollama-RAG-Chatbot
Built using Ollama, an open-source framework for running large language models (LLMs) locally, this chatbot integrates retrieval mechanisms to fetch relevant information before generating responses, making it highly effective for real-time question-answering and knowledge-based interactions.

my chatbot uses LangChain, FAISS, and Ollama to create a smart chatbot that can retrieve information from PDFs (like faculty details) and generate human-like responses.
✨ Key Features
✅ Uses Ollama LLM for response generation
✅ Supports RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for better accuracy
✅ Processes PDF documents and extracts relevant information
✅ Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast vector-based retrieval

Make sure Ollama is running:
ollama list

If no models are installed, download a model - llama 3.1 which i prefered : ollama pull llama3.1
