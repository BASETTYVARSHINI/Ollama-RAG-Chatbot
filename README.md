# Ollama-RAG-Chatbot
Built using Ollama, an open-source framework for running large language models (LLMs) locally, this chatbot integrates retrieval mechanisms to fetch relevant information before generating responses, making it highly effective for real-time question-answering and knowledge-based interactions.

Make sure Ollama is running:
ollama list

If no models are installed, download a model:llama 3.1 which i prefered
ollama pull llama3.1
